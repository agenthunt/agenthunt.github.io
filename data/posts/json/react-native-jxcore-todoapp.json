  "title": "ReactNative JxCore TodoApp",
  "description": "This is yet another todo app written using react native for frontend and embedded jxcore node backend REST api on top of expressjs and nedb. This was attempt in testing out reactnative. Generally most apps are service based i.e they talk to some server that returns data which is displayed in the UI. The advantage of that is there is a common backend for which clients can be written for different platforms. In some cases you dont want to host a server and maintain it and instead write a standalone app. But the problem of creating standalone app for different platforms will hardly have any code reuse. Enter ReactNative which gives javascript environment for writing native apps. We can start thinking about code reuse. But wait there is another problem. ReactNative does not have a full node environment. It has its own runtime. So you would still have to write the backend part of standalone app specific to the platform you are writing. But we can do better. Enter JxCore which provides complete node environment for different platforms including ios and android. We just write a backend as would do with a  nodejs server backend and just embed that in the standalone app. You could use this embedded backend on any platform even if you hosted a server as well. This project is a attempt at showcasing this kind of architecture.",
