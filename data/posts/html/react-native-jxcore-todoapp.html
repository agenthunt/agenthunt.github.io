    This is yet another todo app written using <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">react native</a> for frontend and embedded <a href="http://jxcore.com/home/">jxcore</a> node backend REST api on top of <a href="http://expressjs.com/en/index.html">expressjs</a>
    and <a href="https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb">nedb</a>. This was an attempt in testing out reactnative as well. <span id="todoApp" class="less"> Generally most apps are service based i.e they talk to some server
    that returns data which is displayed in the UI. The advantage of that is there is a common backend for which clients can
    be written for different platforms. In some cases you dont want to host a server and maintain it and instead write a standalone
    app. But the problem of creating standalone app for different platforms will hardly have any code reuse. Enter ReactNative
    which gives javascript environment for writing native apps. We can start thinking about code reuse. But wait there is another
    problem. ReactNative does not have a full node environment. It just has a javascript runtime with some polyfills. So you would still have to write the
    backend part of standalone app specific to the platform you are writing. But we can do better. Enter JxCore which provides
    complete node environment for different platforms including ios and android. We just write a backend as would do with a nodejs
    server backend and just embed that in the standalone app. You could use this embedded backend on any platform even if you
    hosted a server as well. This project is an attempt at showcasing this kind of architecture.
